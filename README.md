# Grammar Correction with T5 and Optuna

This project uses the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model from the Hugging Face Transformers library and Optuna for hyperparameter tuning to correct grammatical errors in English sentences.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.7 or later
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Optuna
- NLTK
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch transformers optuna nltk pandas scikit-learn
```

## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the prerequisites
3. Run the Jupyter notebook
